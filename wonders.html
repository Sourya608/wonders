                Chichén Itzá is a complex of Mayan ruins on Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula. A massive step pyramid,
                known as El Castillo or Temple of Kukulcan, dominates the ancient city, which thrived from around 600 A.D.
                to the 1200s. Graphic stone carvings survive at structures like the ball court, Temple of the Warriors 
                and the Wall of the Skulls. Nightly sound-and-light shows illuminate the buildings'sophisticated geometry.

            <p>Petra is a famous archaeological site in Jordan's southwestern desert. 
                Dating to around 300 B.C., it was the capital of the Nabatean Kingdom. 
                Accessed via a narrow canyon called Al Siq, it contains tombs and 
                temples carved into pink sandstone cliffs, earning its nickname, 
                the "Rose City." Perhaps its most famous structure is 45m-high Al Khazneh,
                 a temple with an ornate, Greek-style facade, and known as The Treasury.
